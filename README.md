# FILE-MANAGER

This code uses the os module to list all the files in the specified directory and loop through them.
For each file, it uses os.path.splitext to split the file name and extension, and then renames the file by adding a prefix to the name.
Finally, it uses os.rename to rename the file.

You can modify this code to perform other file management tasks,
such as moving files from one location to another or copying files from one folder to another.
